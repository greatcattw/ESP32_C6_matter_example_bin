# ESP32_C6_matter_example_bin
ESP32 C6 matter lighting bin file. It is work with Google Nest Hub.  

After downloaded 1.4G esp-idf and 17G esp-matter, I done the bin file.  
Just for testing.


Need to setting google developer console for google home and Google Nest Hub.
Then you can control ESP32 C6 over voice.
